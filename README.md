# FPGA-y-Lenguajes-de-Descripcion

This repository showcases several FPGA projects developed during my coursework in Digital Systems and FPGA Design, using VHDL, Quartus Prime, and the Cyclone V FPGA platform.

All designs were written in VHDL, simulated in Quartus, and accompanied by schematics (block diagrams) and waveform simulations for verification and understanding.

## ðŸ”§ Tools and Technologies
HDL Language: VHDL

FPGA Platform: Intel Cyclone V

IDE: Quartus Prime

Simulation: Quartus Integrated Waveform Simulator

Design Assets: RTL code, functional simulation, and schematic/block diagrams
